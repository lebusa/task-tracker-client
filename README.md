# Getting Started with the Tasks Tracker React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# This repo uses a MongoDB API.

You will need to have a MongoDB API (or a backend of your choice) running in order to see this project in action. A corresponding `Tasks Tracker API` is available on the repos list ([here](https://github.com/lebusa/task-tracker-api/tree/master)). 
                         
The React App makes requets to the `/tasks` endpoint.

Ensure that the backend is running before starting the React App.

## Available Scripts
Clone the repo.

Go into the project directory:

### cd `path/to/directory`

Install the required packages:

### `npm install`

Once completed, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
